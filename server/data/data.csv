"Great barrier reef, Australia",Rising Ocean Temperatures,18,147,"The Great Barrier Reef in Australia has one of the most substancial coral reef ecosystems. However rising ocean temperatures have caused damage to the corals, termed coral bleaching which caused much of the corals to die, affecting its marine inhabitants.",1998
Taku Glacier,Melting Glacier,58,-134,"Taku Glacier is a tidewater glacier located in Taku Inlet in the U.S. state of Alaska. The Taku Glacier, located north of Juneau, Alaska, has started to retreat as temperatures rise.",2016
Greenland Ice Sheet,Melting Glacier,76,-41,"As global temperatures rise, the Greenland ice sheet is melting more quickly. Average ice loss for Greenland over the full 18-year record was 268 plus or minus 14 billion metric tons per year. Within the next 1,000 years, if global heating continues, the vast ice sheet is likely to vanish altogether.",2019
Aletsch Glacier,Melting Glacier,46,8,The Aletsch Glacier contains over a fifth of the total ice volume in the Swiss Alps and is by far the largest glacier in the European Alps. Yet it has already retreated by over 3 kilometres since 1870 and is expected to lose at least half of its volume by 2100 according to the most optimistic projections.,2019
New Moore Island,Rising Sea Levels,21,89,"New Moore, also known as South Talpatti and Purbasha Island, was a small uninhabited offshore sandbar island in the Bay of Bengal, off the coast of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta region. New Moore island in the Sunderbans has been completely submerged due to the rising sea levels. ",2010
Cape Verde,Rising Sea Levels,16,-23,"Cape Verde is a nation comprising a group of islands off the west coast of Africa. Like many island states, Cape Verde is vulnerable to climate change impacts because of its small surface area, high population density, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of potable water resources. Because of its geographic vulnerability, Cape Verde is also prone to natural catastrophes. The archipelago has embarked on a strategy to integrate environmental issues into its planning goals and promote sustainable development.",2019
Canary Islands,Rising Sea Levels,28,-16,"Climate change is reportedly having a profound effect on animal life in the Canary Islands, which are located just off the coast of Morocco in the Atlantic Ocean. Government officials have raised concerns that rising temperatures could allow non-native pests to flood the islands, which could destroy the agricultural industry and be expensive to treat. Agricultural groups in the islands have also noted that droughts, heat waves, and dust storms blowing across the water from the nearby Sahara Desert could spell disaster for the country’s food sector.",2019
Tangier Island,Rising Sea Levels,37,-75,"Tangier Island, Virginia, also called the soft-shell capital of the world, is on the front lines of climate change in the United States. The highest point of the island is just 6 feet above sea level. The island has lost two-thirds of of land area since 1850 because of the longer term effects from what is called glacial rebound. The island has been sinking by about an inch a year because of rising sea levels. Storm-powered erosion and sea-level rise may force people to flee the island. The state of Virginia has offered $3 million to build a wall around the island’s harbor, but residents think they need a wall around the whole island to save it from being inundated.",2019
Bermeja,Rising Sea Levels,22,-91,"Bermeja is a phantom islet lying off the north coast of the Yucatán peninsula according to several maps of the Gulf of Mexico from the 16th to the 20th centuries. Explanations for its apparent disappearance include an erroneous observation by the early cartographers, shifts in the geography of the ocean floor, rising sea levels and conspiracy theories claiming that the Central Intelligence Agency destroyed the island to expand the economic zone allotted to the United States.",2010
Seychelles Islands,Rising Sea Levels,-4,55,"The 115-island archipelago in the Indian Ocean is primarily a tourist destination — but its beaches are eroding. Theoretically, just one meter (39 inches) of sea-level rise may sink 70% of the nation’s entire land. So far, the annual sea-level rise in the Seychelles has fluctuated, but between 2002 and 2006 there were five instances when it reached almost 4 inches due to extreme storm events and flooding.",2010
"Glacier National Park, Montana",Melting Glacier,48,-113,"Global warming has accelerated glacier melt. Between 1966 and 2015, all of the 26 named glaciers in the park got smaller. Some lost as much as 80% of their area, but the average loss was 40%,destorying the home for many of its inhabitants, rising its endangered species. For years, the park predicted all of its glaciers would be gone by 2020.",1966
Maldive Islands,Rising Sea Levels,3,73,"The fascinating Maldive Islands is known for its beaches, marine life and coral reefs. However climate change is now a potential threat to the island. The sea levels are gradually rising. Most of the land area of Maldives is less than one meter above the sea level. ",2021

Graham Island,Rising Sea Levels,53.4317595,-132.2621738,"Graham Island is the largest island in the Haida Gwaii archipelago, lying off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. Graham Island is one of the most sensitive in Canada to future sea-level rise. Scientists have observed Graham Island's East Beach retreating at a rate of one to three metres per year. In extreme years, the beach has retreated by tens of metres.",2020

Furtwangler Glacier,Melting Glacier,-3.0707298,37.3516679,Furtwangler Glacier is located near the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. The snows of Mount Kilimanjaro will have disappeared within two decades because of global warming. 85 per cent of the ice at the top of the mountain has disappeared over the last 100 years.
